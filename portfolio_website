		<h2> About Ian </h2>
	<p>	 When summer comes along, I am likely at the beach, on a boat or on a hike with my dogs. 
    I'm excited to continue bettering my skills as a programer!
    I haven't completed many coding projects, so I'll tell you about myself here:
        I enjoy skiing and spending time in the mountains.
		 </p>

  <h2> Featured Work </h2>
  <p class="featured">The projects displayed below represent a few of the projects I have been affiliated with. Starting on the left, the poster image of the movie Forrest Gump is a movie trailer project that I created that displays a set of movie titles, trailers, and their poster images. The image in the middle represents my work done with Reno Revolution, an online marketing agency. There I helped design and build websites through Wix, an online web builder. The third image represents a website I helped work on called Ideal Canine. Their company helps train dogs in the Reno/Tahoe area.</p>
