<h1> Portfolio Project</h1>

<p>In this project, I created a portfolio webpage that displays information about myself and the projects I have been featured in. </p>

<p>In order to open this project, download the html titled "portfolio_website", run it, and a webpage with my information should appear on your screen. </p>

<p> My CSS Stylesheet is also available in the repo, if you need to look at it or edit it. </p>
